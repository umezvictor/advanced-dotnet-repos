///     host.
///     In order to make this work, there were two things that I needed to overcome (see below). Service Discovery and
///     Shared CookieContainers.
///     - With manually run aspire host.The advantage of this is that you can keep your aspire host running
///     and only iterate on your tests. This is more efficient for writing the tests.It also leaves the door open to
///     re-using these tests to run them against a deployed in stance somewhere in the future.Downside is that you cannot
///     debug both your tests and host at the same time because visual studio compiles them in the same location.
///     - With NCrunch. It turns out that NCrunch doesn't support building aspire projects.
///     However, I've always found that iterating over tests using ncrunch is the fastest way to get feedback.So, to make
///     this work, I had to add a conditional compilation.
