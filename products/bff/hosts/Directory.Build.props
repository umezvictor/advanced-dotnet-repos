    <!-- This line is needed because:
    
    Aspire needs a single target framework 
      (until this is resolved: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/2962)
    
    When you add <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework> then aspire thinks there are more than
    one framework. But this causes a problem for the Directory.Packages.props file.

    In the Directory.Packages.props where we check for $(TargetFramework) == 'net9.0',
    which is ONLY set if you use <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework> in the csproj file, not
    if you set <TargetFramework>. 

    Now normally it's not recommended to set both, however, since this is only for samples, AND
    we do need this check, we're setting it here as well. 

      -->
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
